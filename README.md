# Recipify: Frontend Demo

This is a sample application for various frontend technologies.

![Screenshot of example application](screenshot.png)

### Techstack

**Backend:**

- Java (JDK21), Spring Boot 3.2
- Postgres 16

**Frontend (Next.js)**

- Next.js 14.1
- Zod
- TypeScript
- more a "backend for frontend" (than a frontend) here as it uses that java "backend" as "backend" :-/

**Frontend (Single-Page-App)**

- React 18
- TypeScript
- Vite
- TanStack Router and TanStack Query
- TypeScript and zod-Code for typesafe API access is automatically generated from OpenAPI definitions.
  - You can find [more on that here](https://github.com/nilshartmann/end-to-end-typesafety-spring-boot-typescript).

I recorded a **video on TanStack Router**, that uses this demo example. You can find the [video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/KkrS_wfFq2I).

## Running the backend

The backend that provides the API for the JS frontends and the HTMX endpoints is implemented with Spring Boot and Java.

In order to run it, you either have to use Java or use the prebuild Docker Image.

The easiest is to use the `docker-compose-backend.yaml` file in the root of this project, that starts the backend and the postgres database. You do not need to have installed for it to run:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-backend.yaml up -d
```

If you're a Java ("fullstack") developer, you can instead launch the backend from your IDE by running the Spring Boot class `nh.recipify.TestBackendApplication`. This also automatically starts the postgres database using Testcontainers. (Note that you need to have JDK21 installed)

In either way, the backend runs on http://localhost:8080.

## Using the HTMX frontend

Please see `backend/readme.md` for more informations.

## Running the SPA frontend

The frontend is a Single-Page-Application built with Vite and uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as package manager.

If you have not installed pnpm already, you can enable it with [Node.js corepacks](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v20.x/api/corepack.html) by running on your terminal:

```
corepacks enable
```

(Probably installing the packages with npm or yarn would work too, but I have not tested it.)

Then install and start the Vite devserver for the frontend:

```
cd frontend
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The frontend runs on http://localhost:8090

## Running the Next.js app

If you have not installed pnpm already, you can enable it with [Node.js corepacks](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v20.x/api/corepack.html) by running on your terminal:

```
corepacks enable
```

(Probably installing the packages with npm or yarn would work too, but I have not tested it.)

Then install and start the Next.js devserver for the frontend:

```
cd frontend_nextjs
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The frontend runs on http://localhost:8100
